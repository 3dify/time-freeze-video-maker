	<h1>REALD PRIVACY POLICY  </h1>
	<p>
		This Privacy Policy may be revised from time to time. It was most recently updated on March 15, 2010. By accessing or using RealD website (the “Site”), you agree to the terms of the most recent version of this Privacy Policy.</p>
	<h2> COLLECTING PERSONAL INFORMATION  </h2>
	 <p>We collect information about you when you make a purchase online. This basic information may include your name, mailing and billing address, zip code, phone number, birth date and/or email address. We may also ask for this information if you choose to participate in a survey, sweepstakes, contest, promotion or give-away. We consider information that personally identifies you, such as your name, email address or billing information, and other data that is linked to such information, to be personal information.  
	 </p>
 	<p>With sales transactions, we may collect payment information including credit/debit card information, gift card and merchandise credit numbers, and/or checking account information. When you make a purchase online, we collect transactional information related to your purchase (i.e. what you bought, the price you paid, the payment method you used, and if the product was on sale). </p>
 	<p>  We also collect some personal information when you use other features of the Site. We collect your e-mail address if you sign up for our e-mail list. In order to establish an online account, you will be asked to provide your name, e-mail address, and Zip code, and you will also need to establish a password.   
	 </p>

 	<h2>BROWSING ON OUR WEBSITE  </h2>
 	<p>When you are using our Site, we log your IP address (a number that identifies your computer on the Internet) for system administration, troubleshooting and to examine overall traffic trends. For example, IP addresses help us determine the percentage of people coming from various online gateways, such as Google or Yahoo!. This information (in aggregate form) is recorded for administrative purposes only; IP addresses are not linked to your personal information.  </p>
 	<p>Another tool we use is called a cookie, which is a small data file stored on your computer that allows us to customize portions of our site to your preferences. Generally, we use cookies to remind us of who you are, tailor our product selection to you, and to ensure that only you have access to your account. The cookie, by itself, doesn't provide any personal information, such as your name or email address. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) However, you may not be able to use some features of the Site if you set your browser to reject cookies.  
 	</p>
 	<p>
		We also use cookies and other tools to collect information about how you use the Site (for example, information about what pages you look at, what terms you use in searching the site, or what products you investigate or purchase). This information may be collected directly by us, or it may be collected by a third party service provider. However, we collect only anonymous information about this kind of usage of the Site. This information is not linked to any information that personally identifies you.   You can browse our Site and read our editorial content without providing any personal information. However, you must provide personal information in order to make a purchase.
	</p>
	<h2>
		HOW WE MAY USE YOUR INFORMATION  
	</h2>
	<p>
In order to serve you better, we may combine the information you provide us and the information we have from your purchases online and in our stores. We may also utilize information that is publicly available. This information, in total, is used to improve your overall experience with our company. Here are the ways we use information about you in order to enhance your shopping experience at RealD.com:  
<ul>
<li>To complete your purchases. We use information about your transactions, including personal information you have provided, in order to process payments you have made and deliver products you have ordered. In doing so, we may transmit payment information to third parties, such as banks, credit card companies, or payment clearance services. We may also provide shipping information to third parties in order to permit them to deliver products to you.  </li>
<li>For marketing and promotional purposes. We may send targeted direct mail and catalogs to our customers about products or events that we think may be of interest to them, based on past purchases at RealD.com. We may also send offers for discounts or promotions and information about campaigns, new products or new Site features. In addition, we may send email communications to let customers know about promotions, organizational tips, and the most up-to-date happenings online at RealD.com.   </li>
<li>To improve the content and navigation on our Site. For example, we may use cookies or other tools to track which sections or products online are most often visited and in what order.   </li>
<li>To enhance your online shopping experience. For example, we may use information about you to recognize you and welcome you back to the site, personalizing your shopping experience.   </li>
</ul>
<h2>SHARING YOUR INFORMATION &amp; THIRD PARTY PARTNERSHIPS  </h2>
<p>
On occasion, RealD shares information collected from our customers with selected third party companies who assist the company in advertising and marketing efforts. For example, we may retain an outside company to help us with customer research or to manage a customer database, to send catalogs or direct mail, or to send e-mail messages. The information we provide to third parties for such purposes may include your name, address, e-mail address and purchase information, which will help us target marketing communications The third parties to whom we provide such information agree to keep it confidential, and may not use it to send advertisements or other communications on behalf of anyone other than RealD. RealD also provides some anonymous information about customer purchases to third party companies that assist us with advertising and promoting our products and services.
</p>
<p>
  We participate in special partnerships with other companies that we believe offer products or services that our customers would be interested in and would benefit from. We do not share customers’ personal information with these partner companies. Customers may receive information about these partnerships and related promotions directly from RealD or from the third party companies that assist us with marketing.   
</p>
<p>
RealD may also enter into a "co-branding" relationship with another company, or organization. At times, we may communicate with customers on behalf of that company and customers may be directed to a partner website to purchase a specific item or learn about their services. In these cases, both RealD and the partner company may receive personal information you provide.   
</p>
<p>
Additionally, like many other companies, RealD may use outside marketing companies to place advertisements or links on other websites. The marketing company or the operator of the website where an advertisement or link appears may collect information about people who click on an advertisement for or link to RealD. RealD is not responsible for the collection or use of information by such marketing companies or third party websites.   
</p>
<p>
Third parties may receive your personal information because you have visited their websites or accessed their links. Please refer to their privacy policies to learn about how they handle your personal information. Please note that RealD has no control over the privacy practices of other companies of websites, and we do not assume any responsibility or liability for any third-party’s data collection or disclosure practices, their failure to abide by their privacy policies, or the content of their websites. 
</p>
<p>
 In the event that RealD is merged with or acquired by another company, or in the event of a transfer of our assets, we may disclose or transfer personal information and other information about usage of the site in connection with such a transaction. In the event of such a transfer, we will notify you of the change of control of your personal information. You should also be aware that courts may have the authority under certain circumstances to permit personal information and other information about usage of the site to be shared or transferred to third parties without your permission.
</p>   
<h2>DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>   
<p>We will not use or disclose your personal information except: (1) as described in this Privacy Policy; (2) after obtaining your permission to a specific use or disclosure; (3) if it is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities who may be causing injury to you, to RealD, or to others; (4) if we are required to do so in order to comply with any valid legal process or governmental request (such as a court order, search warrant, subpoena, civil discovery request, or statutory requirement); or (5) as we otherwise believe is required by law.
</p>
</p>
<p>
SECURITY OF OUR SITE  We use encryption and authentication tools to protect the security of the information that you share with us. Once we receive your transmission, we will do our best to protect its security on our systems. For example, we protect personal information we gather on a secured server behind a firewall; it is not directly connected to the Internet.  Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to or from our Site, and you do so at your own risk. Accordingly, we disclaim liability for any theft, loss, or interception of or any unauthorized access or damage to any data or communications. By using the Site, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume these risks.   Anyone with access to the e-mail address and password you use to create an account with us can obtain access to the personal information you have provided to us. We urge you to keep your password in a safe place and not share it with anyone. Always sign out from your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit to our Site. This ensures that others cannot access your account, which is especially important if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place.  You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account password, and you are responsible for any access to or use of the Site by any person or entity using your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by you.   __ REVIEWING AND REVISING YOUR ACCOUNT INFORMATION  You may review and make changes to the personal information that is stored in your user account on the Site by visiting the “My Account” area of the Site.   __ OPTING OUT  While we hope that the information included in this Privacy Policy has helped you better understand how we use and protect your information to provide you with better service, we understand that you may still choose to not receive information from RealD or our partners.  As a part of our commitment to your privacy, we agree to: (1) provide customers with notice of their ability to opt out of information rental, sale or exchange with other marketers; (2) honor customers' requests not to share their information with other marketers; and (3) honor customers' requests not to receive mail or email from RealD.  • Information Rental, Sale or Exchange. RealD does not rent, sell, or otherwise provide your personal information to any third parties or corporate affiliates for purposes of allowing them to engage in direct marketing to you on behalf of anyone other than RealD.   • Email Opt Out. All of our marketing emails include a link for unsubscribing to our emails. Immediately after unsubscribing, you will no longer receive marketing emails from RealD. You may still receive e-mails regarding your transactions, for example confirming that you have placed an order or that a product you have ordered has shipped.   __ ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS  By using our Site, you agree to RealD’s Privacy Policy. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of this policy at any time. If this policy changes in the future, we will let you know by posting the updated policy on our Site with the most recent modification date. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of our Site following the posting of changes to these terms means you accept those changes.   __ CHILDREN AND PRIVACY  The RealD.com is not directed to children under the age of 13 years. We will never request personally identifiable information from anyone whom we know to be under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent. By using the Site, you represent and warrant that you are at least 13 years old. If we become aware that a customer is under the age of 13 and has registered without prior verifiable parental consent, we will remove his or her personally identifiable registration information.   __ QUESTIONS  If you need any other information, please submit your requests or questions to Will Hammond at whammond@reald.com.

A special note for parents concerning privacy </span></p><p class="c7"><span>Vue makes a special effort to encourage children to consult with their parents before disclosing personal information via our website. However, it is ultimately the responsibility of parents to supervise their children’s online activities and should consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a child-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing their name, address and other personal information online without parental permission. Vue shall use its reasonable endeavours, whenever possible, to ensure that personal information about or obtained from a child will not be used for commercial or trade purposes and that personal information will not be collected from children under 12 without the prior written consent of their parent or legal guardian. </span></p><p class="c7 c8"><span></span></p></div>
